                    Jerome Allen Seinfeld (born April 29, 1954)[1] is an
                    American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He
                    is best known for having played a semi-fictionalized version
                    of himself in the sitcom Seinfeld (1989–1998), which he
                    created and wrote with Larry David. The show aired on NBC
                    from 1989 until 1998, becoming one of the most acclaimed and
                    popular sitcoms of all time. As a stand-up comedian,
                    Seinfeld specializes in observational comedy. In 2004,
                    Comedy Central named him the 12th-greatest stand-up comedian
                    of all time.Seinfeld was born in Brooklyn, New York City.
                    His father, Kálmán Seinfeld, a sign painter, was Jewish and
                    collected jokes that he heard while serving in World War II.
                    His mother, Betty (née Hosni) and her parents, Selim and
                    Salha Hosni, were Jews from Aleppo, Syria. Their nationality
                    was stated as Turkish when they immigrated in 1917, as Syria
                    was under the Ottoman Empire. Seinfeld has an older sister,
                    Carolyn. Salha's mother Garez Dayan, Seinfeld's
                    great-grandmother, was a member of the Dayan rabbinic
                    family, who claim ancestry back to the Medieval Exilarchs,
                    and from the Exilarchs back to the Biblical King David.
                    Seinfeld's second cousin is musician and actor Evan
                    Seinfeld. Seinfeld grew up in Massapequa, New York, and
                    attended Massapequa High School on Long Island. At 16, he
                    spent time volunteering in Kibbutz Sa'ar in Israel. He
                    attended the State University of New York at Oswego, and
                    transferred after his second year to Queens College, City
                    University of New York, from which he graduated in 1976 with
                    a degree in communications and theater.
